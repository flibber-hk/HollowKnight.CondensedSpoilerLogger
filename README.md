# HollowKnight.CondensedSpoilerLogger

Hollow Knight Randomizer add-on to create a condensed spoiler log. Adds the following logs:

- CondensedSpoilerLog: Summarises the locations of the most important items.
- NotchCostSpoiler: Lists the randomized notch costs. Only generated with notch costs randomized.
- AreaSortedItemSpoilerLog: Lists the items placed at randomized locations, with the locations grouped by area.
- OrderedItemProgressionSpoilerLog: Lists the randomized item placements in an order that they could be collected to complete the seed.
Progression Sphere 0 consists of the items reachable from the start. Each subsequent sphere consists of all items reachable with the previous sphere's items.
There is no guarantee that the order the items appear in this log reflects the order that the randomizer placed them; it is simply one possible such order.
- FilteredItemProgressionSpoilerLog: The same as the ordered spoiler, except it only logs items that will unlock something later.
Note - the log generated is minimal in the sense that every item is required. However, it is possible that fewer items can be used in a different way;
for instance, the log may list all stags besides Stag Nest Stag (which unlocks stag access to Stag Nest) and not Stag Nest Stag itself - none
of these can be removed, even though the number of items in the log can be reduced.
- CollectedItemSpoiler: Collects locations with the same item and groups them together. Items which appear only once are placed
at the bottom of the log.
- SourceTransitionSpoiler / TargetTransitionSpoiler: If transitions are randomized, lists transition placements grouped by area.
The first log groups placements by the source transition, the second groups placements by the target.
For the most part, this distinction only matters when transitions are not coupled.

Also adds an API for connections to add to the CondensedSpoilerLog.

## Open Logs Folder

After randomization is successful, the start randomizer page will display a button to open the logs folder. This will write all spoiler
logs to the `Randomizer 4/Recent` directory and open it. The logs generated in this way may be inaccurate if playing a mode other than regular
randomizer (such as Multiworld).

For technical reasons, the RawSpoiler.json file written at this time is different to the RawSpoiler.json written when entering the
file properly. Consequently, the raw spoiler written in this way is called TempRawSpoiler.json. (It will be replaced with
the correct RawSpoiler.json when entering the file.)

This option can be disabled in the global settings.

## Global Settings

Any of the logs can be disabled in the global settings file. Once a log has been written once, its logger name should appear in the
global settings. Set the value to `false` in order to prevent writing that log in future.

## Translation

It is possible to modify the names that appear in the logs created by CondensedSpoilerLogger (except for the NotchCostSpoiler). To do so,
create a file called `translation.json` in the same directory as this mod. That file should look like

```
{
    "item_name_1": "translated_name_1",
	"item_name_2": "translated_name_2",
	...
}
```

Item and location names can both appear in this file; if an item and location share a name, then they will both be translated.
